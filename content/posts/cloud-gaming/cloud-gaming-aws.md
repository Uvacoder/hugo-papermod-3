# The problem
During times of a pandemic, many have reverted to their desks at home not only for work, but also beyond it. All this started, as I tried to play CyberPunk 2077 ü§ñ. Now, I'm not gamer, please don't judge me, but I do enjoy a good book, and sci-fi is my forte. So couldn't give this one a pass. The challenge was that I've quite a beefy rig, with 32GB DDR4 ram, and a 16-core XEON, with a measly Quadro k1200 üòì. Even worse was trying on the [XBOX One X from last generation](https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/xbox/sp-technical/issue/1763/my-game-crashes-8) constantly crashing.

‚òÅ Cloud gaming has taken shape rapidly in 2020, behind the scenes with platforms such as Stadia, GeForce NOW, and even AWS launching [Luna](https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page). However, wide adoption is yet to be seen here in this subcontinent, with us still relying on painfully slow NBN, and over expensive capped mobile 5G data. To add to the pain, the price of a relatively new GPU is to sell a kidney off, if they're even available in stores ! The Next-gen consoles, are all out of stock, and [scalpers](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-scalpers-ruining-restocks-what-you-can-do-now) are aiming for afr rich-list this year ü§ë.

This post is about how we can use AWS to our rescue, and leverage gpu instances, albeit not originally designed for gaming, to the rescue.
